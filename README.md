# Sports Ticketing System

This repository contains a very small demonstration of a sports ticketing system built with React and Vite.

The application allows users to list tickets for sporting or concert events and buy available tickets. It is purely client-side and stores tickets in memory, so data will reset on refresh. The project is intended as a simple starting point for further development.

## Running locally

From the `TicketingSystem` directory install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 to view the app.
