# Ticketing System Example

This folder contains a simple React application demonstrating a very small sports ticketing interface. Users can list tickets for events and purchase tickets that are available. It uses Vite for development and build tooling.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:5173.
