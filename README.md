# Sports Ticketing System

This repository contains a small demonstration of a sports event ticketing system built with React and Vite. The application lists a few sample events, allows you to view event details and add different ticket types to a cart. Everything is stored in memory so data resets on refresh. Use it as a starting point for further development.

## Running locally

From the `TicketingSystem` directory install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 to view the app.
